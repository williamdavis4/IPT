# IPT
IPT is a swift and precise tool crafted for tracing IP addresses, unveiling their geolocation data, revealing ISP specifics, and conducting reverse DNS lookups. Harnessing the power of both IPAPI and IP-API services, it distills a comprehensive set of details about a target IP and elegantly exhibits them in a user-friendly, colored terminal output.
